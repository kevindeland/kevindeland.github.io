<h3>My Values</h3>
<ul>
  <h4>Creativity</h4>
  Reassembling things in an unpredictable way that subverts expectations and generates something new.
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>
  <h4>Curiosity</h4>
  A fascination with the world and how it works, and an insatiable desire for more data, more stories,
  more systems, more perspectives, and more experiences.
</ul>
<br><br>


<ul>
  <h4>Vulerability</h4>
  Confronting challenging truths about oneself and examining/integrating them so that they can be shared
  with others. Finding discomforts and exanding into them with courage and openness.
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>
  <h4>Self-Expression</h4>
  <i>It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion.
    It is easy in solitude to live after your own.
    But the great man is he who in the midst of a crowd,
    keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.
    </i>
    - Ralph Waldo Emerson
</ul>

<h3>People whose work inspires me</h3>

<ul>

    <h4><a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a></h4>
    Let's say there's a magic genie with the power to copy the entire collection
    of knowledge and skills in someone's brain and upload it into a different person.
    If that genie gave me the choice to receive a brain upload from *one* single person,
    I would choose Bret Victor.

    <h4><a href="https://ncase.me/">Nicky Case</a></h4>
    The only person I'm currently supporting on Patreon! Nicky's explorable explanations
    teach interesting subjects in the most engaging and interactive way.
    <a href="https://ncase.me/trust/">The Evolution of Trust</a> or
    <a href="https://ncase.me/neurons/">Neurotic Neurons</a> might be a good place to start,
    but you can't go wrong with anything on her site.

<br><br><br>
    <h4><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/">Tim Urban</a></h4>
    (No, not Keith Urban). I love the way he writes. His metaphors are excellent.
     His articles always make me think about life from a new perspective.
     <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html">This one</a>
     will really make you appreciate your time left on this planet.
