I have been working as the lead software engineer on a project called RoboTutor since August 2017. It’s been an amazing ride. RoboTutor is one of five $1M Finalists in the $15M Global Learning XPRIZE. This international competition seeks to address the acute shortage of teachers in developing countries. The goal is to create an open-source Android tablet app that enables children ages 7-10 with little or no access to schools to learn basic reading, writing, and arithmetic without adult assistance. We are currently field-testing the Swahili version of RoboTutor in Tanzania.

I received my Master’s degree in Educational Technology and Applied Learning Science (METALS for short) from Carnegie Mellon University. I love learning and creating, and I want to share those loves with the world. I believe we have too many consumers and not enough creators, and that the right values of curiosity and creativity can be instilled at a young age.
<br><br><br>
My background spans from math and physics (my favorites in high school), to Electrical and Computer Engineering (B.S. from Duke), to Software Engineering (four years at IBM), but my interests are literally limitless. Part of why got into Learning Science has been to hone a more scientific grasp of my own learning process, and build practices that will help guide me along the road from Jack-of-all-Trades, Master-of-None to Jack-of-all-Trades, Master-of-Many.

<h3>People whose work inspires me</h3>

<ul>

    <h4><a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a></h4>
    Let's say there's a magic genie with the power to copy the entire collection
    of knowledge and skills in someone's brain and upload it into a different person.
    If that genie gave me the choice to receive a brain upload from *one* single person,
    I would choose Bret Victor.

    <h4><a href="https://ncase.me/">Nicky Case</a></h4>
    Nicky is the only person I'm currently supporting on Patreon! I love the way she uses story-telling and agent-based programming to teach compelling subjects.
    <a href="https://ncase.me/trust/">The Evolution of Trust</a> or
    <a href="https://ncase.me/neurons/">Neurotic Neurons</a> might be a good place to start,
    but you can't go wrong with anything on her site.

<br><br><br>
    <h4><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/">Tim Urban (WaitButWhy)</a></h4>
    I love the way Tim writes about history, psychology, and what it's like to be alive.
     His articles always make me think about life from a new perspective, and his metaphors are excellent.

     will really make you appreciate your time left on this planet.
