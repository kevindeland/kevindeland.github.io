This Thursday I made my first ever free throw in a basketball game while standing on one leg! I was fouled on a shot (which totally should have been a jump ball, but that's okay), and got two free throws. I came up short on the first, as I was still a bit hesitant to shoot with one foot.

Why shoot with one foot? It forces me to focus on my balance. If I am just sitting casually at the free throw line, my mind tends to wander. But if I am forced to align my balance, I must be completely present with my body, living completely in the moment.

I wonder... if I get too good at free throws on one leg, will I have to add another layer of difficulty?
