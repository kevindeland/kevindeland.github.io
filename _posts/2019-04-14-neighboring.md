My friend has an art gallery where she hosts a different artist each month. She put out a call
for people to meet a neighbor they don't know and then make a piece of art about it.

So I invited my neighbor over for dinner and we had takeout together. Then I turned our takeout containers
into flying saucers, cut out some stars and aliens, and made this little scene.

Food can be a *vehicle* for human connection. So I invited my neighbor over for dinner,
and then I turned our takeout containers into *flying saucers*
Our neighbors may seem *alien* to us, like they are *unidentified friendly objects*. But we can use food to *explore each otherâ€™s worlds*.
