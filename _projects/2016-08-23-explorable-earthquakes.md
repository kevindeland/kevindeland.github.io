Click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/ExplorableEarthquakes ) to see the working demo.
Based on the example [here](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations)

I had a lot of fun building this for the Watson Cognitive Tutor, a project done by The IBM Watson Education team who worked with a classroom to help prepare 9th graders for their New York Regents exams. I used the [Tangle.js](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/) library to build the reactive sliders, and I used Javascript canvas to illustrate the traveling waves and the Cartesian plot. I also used a creative ananlogy to describe the life of an anthropomorphic earthquake sensor, which may help more students with a more kinesthetic learning style.

This was my first time making an interactive, reactive educational interface, so there are a few improvements I know I could make
- better description at the beginning (although this was used in conjunction with a lesson plan, so the kids would have some background).
