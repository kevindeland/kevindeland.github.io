This was a design project that my team and I built for a class called *Learning Media Design*. We worked with our client, [Maker Ed](https://makered.org/), to design a product that would help work towards a future where portfolios can be incorporated into the college admissions process. More and more students are making use of portfolios as a compilation of their work, a reflection of their personality, and a self-evaluative tool
