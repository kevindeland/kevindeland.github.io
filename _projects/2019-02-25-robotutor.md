[RoboTutor](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/robotutor/) is one of five $1M Finalists in the $15M [Global Learning XPRIZE](http://learning.xprize.org). This international competition seeks to address the acute shortage of teachers in developing countries.  The goal is to create an open-source Android tablet app that enables children ages 7-10 with little or no access to schools to learn basic reading, writing, and arithmetic without adult assistance.  We are continuing to field-test the Swahili version of RoboTutor in Tanzania, mine the data it logs, and improve it accordingly.

I have been working as the lead software engineer on this project since August 2017. It's been a hell of a ride. We recently [open-sourced our code](https://github.com/RoboTutorLLC/RoboTutor/).


Here are some kids learning with RoboTutor!
