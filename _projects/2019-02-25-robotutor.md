For two years I played various roles on Carnegie Mellonâ€™s [RoboTutor](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/robotutor/) team as we competed as finalists for the [Global Learning XPRIZE](http://learning.xprize.org). This international competition sought to address the acute shortage of teachers in developing countries. The goal was to create an open-source Android tablet app that enables children ages 7-10 with little or no access to schools to learn basic reading, writing, and arithmetic without adult assistance.

View the [source code here](https://github.com/RoboTutorLLC/RoboTutor/).

I developed many skills including navigating a complex web of legacy code on my own, enabling and mentoring student developers, and incorporating feedback from user testing in a foreign environment. 

One good example of the end-to-end pipeline of what it takes to implement an interactive learning activity was the base ten addition/subtraction with carrying/borrowing (see more here). 
- Curriculum: noticing an area where our curriculum did not meet the EGMA (Early Grade Math Assessment) standards,
- Research: finding a paper where a researcher had successfully designed an activity to teach to this standard.
- Design: creating prototypes of increasing fidelity, while seeking feedback from an expert
- Implementation: programming the design into the existing product architecture
- Testing: testing the developed product to fix bugs and improve user experience


[RoboTutor](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/robotutor/) is one of five $1M Finalists in the $15M [Global Learning XPRIZE](http://learning.xprize.org). 

I have been working as the lead software engineer on this project since August 2017. It's been a hell of a ride. 


Here are some kids learning with RoboTutor!
